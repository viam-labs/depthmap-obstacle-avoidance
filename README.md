# depthmap-obstacle-avoidance

## In this repo... ##
This repository contains code for performing obstacle detection using only a depth camera.  Specifically, the script main.go is meant for use with the Viam RDK (ideally a Viam rover!) and an Intel RealSense camera.  See [here](https://github.com/viamrobotics/camera-servers) for an explanation of how to set up your Intel RealSense camera.

Be sure to replace the robot secret in the code with your actual robot's secret!
